# JavaFX Snake

For my final project in my 2nd computer science class at UGA, I decided to recreate the 
classic arcade game, Snake, using JavaFX. For the design of the arcade game, I was given
the Game class which consists of a simple game loop and related methods to update the
state of the game.

In order to run the application, the latest version of XMing should be
installed to allow X-Forwarding.
